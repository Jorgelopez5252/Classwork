        <p><strong>"If you dont work hard on your own dream, you will work hard for someone elses
                dream"-Unknown</strong></p>
        <p>Im a big video gamer and collector that has collected a nice haul of trinkits and gear over the years. My
            main hobbies besides those are cooking food, walking my dogs, and hanging out with the boys from time to
            time.</p>

        <p>I was born in San Diego, California but moved to Mesa, Arizona when I was 7 years old. I guess you could say
            I am a native here at this point! My main goals are to achive a passing status with my recent Bootcamp class
            I started, so I may tackle bigger projects in the future!</p>

        <p>My background is mostly sales starting with person to person sales at a Sprint store within a local mall,
            then worked for an insurance broker, and finally started sales with Bank of America as part of the new Chat
            website team! I hope I can stop sales for a bit and get to coding as soon as possible</p>
